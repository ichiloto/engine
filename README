# Ichiloto 2D Game Engine

**Ichiloto 2D Game Engine** is a lightweight, PHP-based game engine designed for creating 2D JRPG-style games using ASCII art in the terminal. Inspired by the classic gameplay of 90s JRPGs such as *Final Fantasy 1-6* and *Dragon Quest*, Ichiloto enables developers to craft immersive retro experiences directly in the console.

### Features
- **ASCII Art Rendering:** Build and display rich, visually expressive game worlds entirely with ASCII characters.
- **Turn-Based Battle System:** Create strategic and engaging combat inspired by classic JRPG mechanics.
- **Event System:** Implement complex in-game events and cutscenes using a simple, extensible architecture.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs seamlessly in any environment with PHP support.

### Goals
Ichiloto 2D Game Engine aims to provide an accessible platform for developers and enthusiasts to bring nostalgic, text-based adventures to life while maintaining the depth and charm of traditional JRPG gameplay.

### Roadmap
- Core game loop implementation
- Map editor and ASCII art design tools
- Save/load system
- Advanced battle system customization
- Scripting support for quests and events

Join us on this journey to redefine retro gaming with the power of ASCII art and PHP!
